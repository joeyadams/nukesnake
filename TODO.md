 * Make sure the Allegro 4 port can be built on Windows and Mac OS X.
 * Implement game point and game over.
 * Add sounds for nuke pick-up and launch.
 * Fix nuke and mine detonator behavior if original game has better mechanics.
 * Support multiple nuke radii (low priority)

TODO CLOSING 20071203:  Follow above steps.  Add corresponding menus to TIGCC and bring both tigcc and allegro versions to parity.
